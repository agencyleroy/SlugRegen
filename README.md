# SlugRegen

A Craft CMS plugin for regenerating slugs for all entries in any or all of your locales.

You can also choose to generate a CSV in the format `"locale";"old uri";"new uri"`, which will be put in the root of your Craft project.

If the reason you are regenerating entry slugs is to remove non-ASCII characters from the slugs, you can choose to skip those slugs.
